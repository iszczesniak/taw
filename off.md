If you're mathematically-minded, let me recommend a book worth
reading: "How to Solve It" by George PÃ³lya.  It's a charming,
popular-science book on mathematics that you can tell was written and
polished over years.  I found the bits on mathematical proofs useful
and interesting.  It's a good bedtime book.
