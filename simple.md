Master good writing, because nobody will write your text better than
you.  A native might help, but:

* they will not substantially correct your text (like rewriting a
  paragraph), only correct minor mistakes,

* they will not fully understand what you wrote,

* they often dispense subjective advice of little importance,

* at the end they give you a nice feeling that it was checked by a
  native, but in fact you got very little.

My simple advice for better writing is to write and rewrite your text
until you are sure that you:

* wrote what you wanted,

* fully understand what you wrote: if you read your text, and are not
  exactly sure what you wanted to say, then you'll have to revise,

* wrote succinctly (shorter is better, less is more), i.e., you didn't
  beat around the bush; you didn't write a long-winded text,

* make your text clear, easy to follow, and a pleasure to read, so
  don't make it overly short (terse), and spartan.

Kids do it well, because they are direct.

Advice on studying English: make it fun and your priority:

- study intently seminal papers: e.g., Dijkstra paper,

- use it as much as you can:

  - take notes in English,

  - write and rewrite your articles, carying about your English.

- if you want to have good pronunciation and intonation:

  - study the phonetic script,

  - sing along with your favourite singer: I love Dido, Anja Garbarek,

  - watch great movies: Interstellar, Memento, No country for old men,
    Capote, Truman Show, A place beyond the pines, Drive, Gravity,
    Kinsey, Leon, Whiplash, Shadow Dancer,

  - listen to podcasts, and audio books: Hardcore History, Common
    Sense, Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Audible

- study grammar only when you have to: you are writing a paper, and
  you have to make sure you're not making a mistake.
