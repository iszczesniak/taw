# Cohesion and coherence of a paragraph

We already know how to write a clear sentence (or a clause): make the
doer the subject, and express the action of the doer with a verb.
Done.  Now we concentrate on a paragraph.

We write a paragraph by putting a few sentences together.  We have a
choice to make the paragraph:

* clear, easy to follow and understand: *a pleasure to read*,

* confusing, and abstruse: *a nightmare to decipher*.

We don't want to get on the nerve of a reader (or a reviewer), so we
have to write the paragraph clear.  Putting together a few sentences
that are clear on their own is not enough.  We have to aim for:

* **cohesion**: the neighboring sentences stick together,

* **coherence**: the paragraph makes sense.

Cohesion and coherence are about context and order, which help us
understand new ideas and follow new lines of reasoning, so that we can
easily make new and clear connections between what we already know,
and the new we're trying to learn and understand.  Cohesion is a
stepping stone to coherence.

# Cohesion

We saw cohesion in action the previous lecture, where the passive
helped us rearrange the keywords *units*, **slot**, and ***demand***
into this example of a clear paragraph:

> The optical spectrum is divided into fine frequency slot *units*.
> Contiguous *units* are concatenated to form a **slot**, which
> [**slot**] is tailored for a specific ***demand***.  A ***demand***
> (...)

Cohesion is about sticking neighboring sentences together.  In the
example paragraph, the first sentence begins with the optical
spectrum, something our reader should already know (the context), and
then introduce the new information at the end of the sentence: the
units, which is the *adhesive* that creates cohesion between this
sentence and the one to follow.

The second sentence of the example paragraph has two clauses.  In the
first clause we connect with the previous sentence with the units (now
the known information), and introduce the new information (the
adhesive): the slot.  The second clause starts with the slot (now the
known information), and introduces the new information (the adhesive):
the demand.  The last sentence picks up on the demand.

Admittedly, we traded the active voice for the passive in the second
sentence, so that the units come first, and the slot comes second,
which, arguably, made this sentence less clear.  This is simply the
trade-off between the clarity of a separate sentence that perhaps we
sacrificed, and the cohesion between sentences that we undoubtedly
gained.

You can ornament your writing with conjunctions like *thus*,
*therefore* or *however*, but they will be useless (and even
confusing) if your reasoning is not presented with cohesive sentences.
Get cohesion like this:

> Fact #1 --> fact #2.  Fact #2 --> fact #3.  Fact #3 --> fact #4.

# Coherence

After reading a coherent paragraph, you know what it was about,
without a doubt.  A coherent paragraph is:

* **focused**: concentrate on the main idea you want to convey,

* **well begun**: state the main idea upfront in the first sentence,

* **short and crisp**: make the paragraph only a few sentences long,

* **elaborate in the middle**: elaborate cohesively on the main idea,

* **finished off**: draw a conclusion, and pave the way for the next
  paragraph.

So the structure of the paragraph should be this:

> Set the stage for the paragraph: state the main idea.  Elaborate:
> Fact #1 --> fact #2.  Fact #2 --> fact #3.  Fact #3 --> fact #4.
> Draw a conclusion, and create a link with the next paragraph.

An example of a coherent paragraph:

> In the literature on optical networking, there is some confusion
> about the basic terminology, which we have to clear up.  The optical
> spectrum is divided into fine frequency slot units.  Contiguous
> units are concatenated to form a slot, which is tailored for a
> specific demand.  A demand can have several characteristics.
>
> We characterize a demand with (...)

# Conclusion

If you understand something, you can write clearly about it.  A
paragraph is clear, when the reasoning is cohesive (flows from one
sentence to the next), and when the paragraph is coherent (has the
structure a reader expects).  A paragraph is a building block of a
section, and, in turn, of an article.  Keep it clear.
