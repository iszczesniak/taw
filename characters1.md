# Introduction to characters

We already know the two main principles of clear writing: the subject
should name the character, and the verb should express the character's
action.  However, a subject can have different forms.

Compare the two sentences.  The first is less clear, because it has
abstract subject phrases:

> **The fear of the CIA** was that **a recommendation from the
> president to Congress** would be for a reduction in its budget.

The second is more clear, because is has simple subjects:

> **The CIA** feared **the president** would recommend to Congress
> that it reduce its budget.

# Advice

**Make the subject *simple and specific*, not long and abstract.**

## Example #1

Revise this sentence:

> Governmental intervention in fast changing technologies has led to
> the distortion of market evolution and interference in new product
> development.

Who is doing what?  We have to infer the doers from the adjectives:
governmental, and market.  In "government intervention", do we refer to
some specific government or maybe governments in general in
"government intervention"?  Likewise, in "market evolution", do we
mean some specific market (e.g., a US computer market?) or markets in
general (e.g., world-wide computer markets)?

Furthermore, the sentence is further obfuscated by nominalizations:

* intervention -> to intervene, distortion ->  to distort

* evolution -> to evolve, interference -> to interfere

While it's clear it's the government who intervened in fast changing
technologies, it's not clear who distorted the market evolution, and
interfered in new product development.  We have a problem then whom to
blame for the distortion and interference (i.e., whom to make the
doers of these actions), and we suspect it was the government.

Let's make the government the primary doer, and the market the other.
One of the ways to revise the sentence is this:

> When a government intervenes in fast changing technologies, it
> distorts how markets evolve and interferes with how they develop new
> products.

We could argue whether the revised sentence has the same meaning as
the original sentence, but we can't argue that the revised sentence is
unclear, unlike the original.

## Example #2

Revise:

> Medieval theological debates often addressed issues considered
> trivial by modern philosophical thought.

Who are the flesh-and-blood characters here?  The *medieval
theologians*, and *modern philosophers*.  Let's make them the subjects
to make the sentence far more clear and to the point:

> **Medieval theologians** often debated issues that **modern
> philosophers** consider trivial.

## Exercise #1

Revise:

> In recent years, the appearance of new interpretations about the
> meaning of the discovery of America has led to a reassessment of
> Columbus's place in Western history.

Here the missing and implied character has to be reconstructed.  We
guess it's the historians who reinterpreted the discovery, and
reassessed the Columbus's place.

## Exercise #2

Revise:

> Tracing transitions in a well-written article provides help in
> efforts at improving coherence in writing.

# Conclusion

Make your character a simple subject of the sentence.  If you do this,
you'll express the character's action with a verb.  That's clear.

Otherwise, your subjects will be nominalizations, and you will have to
refer to your characters with adjectives.  That's confusing.
