Introduction
============

It's not that often that we have to write a *long sentence*, but when
we have to, e.g., to explain something complex, a long sentence is
just right.  We can do without it, and chop the complex into several
sentences, but... we loose the glamour.  It's a matter of style and
skill: can we write a long sentence that is clear and graceful?  A
long sentence should read easily, and it will if we give it the right
**shape**.

A long sentence is clear, when the ideas are presented with clauses in
the right order, similar to the flow of ideas in a paragraph: start
well with the known and simple (to set up the context quickly),
develop your complex ideas, and then conclude firmly with important
information.

In a long sentence we may have to trade the clarity of a clause (for
instance writing it in the passive) for the clarity of a sentence.
The need for clarity of a long sentence is more pressing than of a
paragraph, because a long sentence is read in one go (breath).

Cut if you must.  If a sentence is too long, and packed with too much
information that you cannot reconcile in a single sentence, just chop
it into shorter sentences.

This is an example of a long, yet clear sentence:

> The limited Yen, the modified Dijkstra, and the constrained Yen
> algorithms, which find a candidate path with the Dijkstra algorithm,
> fail to find a shortest path meeting the spectrum and modulation
> constraints, when there is a shorter path unable to meet the
> spectrum and modulation constraints, because that shorter path
> diverts the algorithms into a dead end.

Shape
=====

Inevitably, a long sentence has a few clauses.  The *main clause*
expresses the main idea which is supported by *subordinate (aka
dependent) clauses* (or phrases):

* an **introductory clause** sets up the context for the main clause,

* a **relative clause** relates to the information in the main clause.

First things first.  Before reshaping a long sentence, you should
already have made the doers the subjects of the clauses, expressed the
actions with verbs, dropped nominalizations, and made the other
characters of your story the objects.  That should be cleared up by
now.  Now we can start **reshaping**, i.e., changing and moving around
the clauses and phrases.

Cut to the chase
----------------

Get to the subject of the main clause quickly, and avoid long
introductory phrases (or clauses) as below (which I ventured
nonetheless to stress my point):

> Given the increasing deployment of optical networks, softwarization
> of the network control, the ever-increasing need for bandwidth and
> agility, further increased by content-oriented services, network and
> service orchestration, and the next-generation wireless network
> requirements: a shortest optical path should be found *fast*.

The introductory phrase above could be shortened by dropping some
parts of it, or perhaps moving some parts of it to the end of the
sentence.  However, I chose to put the most important information at
the end instead.

Don't interrupt
---------------

The main clause should not be interrupted by a long relative clause
(or a phrase), especially between **the subject and the verb**, and
between **the verb and the object**.  Move that interrupting clause to
a better place, perhaps the beginning or end of the sentence,
depending on where it connects better with other sentences.

That rule I broke in the first example by interrupting with "which
find a candidate path with the Dijkstra algorithm", but I had little
wiggle room to put it elsewhere.

Here the main clause is interrupted between the subject, and the verb:

> Our generalization, where we allow for revisiting vertices, which
> Dijkstra does not do, seems to discard the label-setting paradigm in
> favor of the label-correcting paradigm.

Let's revise by moving the two relative clauses to the end of the
sentence:

> Our generalization seems to discard the label-setting paradigm in
> favor of the label-correcting paradigm, because we allow for
> revisiting vertices, which Dijkstra does not do.

Here the main clause is interrupted between the verb, and the object.
Revise this sentence to make the interrupting phrase introductory:

> We call, as a tribute to generic programming, the proposed algorithm
> the generic Dijkstra algorithm.

Conclusion
==========

* Writing a long sentence is like writing a paragraph, only more so.

* Get to the subject of the main clause quickly.

* Don't interrupt the main clause with subordinate clauses.
