Introduction
============

For me, elegance is refined lucidity, not pompous bombastic
circumlocution, obscure vocabulary galore.  Technical writing should
be engaging, and clever.  If you think writing is mundane, so will
your writing be: mundane, flat, and boring.  Even though technical
academic writings are not fine literature, there is plenty of room for
refinement.  These refined details give a pleasure, and a moment to
reflect and remember not only for readers, but also for a writer.

We write, read, rewrite, and reread many times to refine.  George
Gamow, so I heard, would write his articles out from memory, writing
the same article as many times as needed, so that he finally felt the
article was right.  This is extreme, especially today when researchers
are supposed to publish ever more, but we get the idea: refinement.

Refinement comes with effort, but is noticed only by careful readers,
and goes mostly unnoticed, let alone appreciated, by most readers,
even by reviewers.  You have to make your choice: quality or quantity.
Most of us choose the latter.  Provided we're not maniacs, how much
effort should we put, if the effort might not be much appreciated?  We
have to balance the effort and the effect, overdoing it might be
imprudent.  We can refine with **balance**.

Balance
=======

Balance is about the symmetry, rhythm, and echo among the parts of a
sentence.  Modifiers helped us before (for rhythm and echo), and now
we use balance.

Balanced coordination
---------------------

Coordination joins (usually two) grammatical units (a word, phrase,
clause) of the same type (verb, subject, object, adjective, main
clause, relative clause) with a conjunction.  Coordination can be as
simple as "black and white", or more elaborate, as in here, of two
relative clauses:

> It's no coincidence that we **start** a sentence with ***the old and
> known information***, and **end** with ***the new and unfamiliar***.

In the above coordination I balanced:

  * "start" vs "end" (grammatical unit = word, type = verb),

  * "the old and known" vs "the new and unfamiliar" (grammatical unit
    = noun phrase, type = object).

I also put the important information at the end of each subordinate
clause (that rule applies not only to a sentence, but to a clause
too), and **gapped** the subject in the second coordinated relative
clause, i.e., removed "a sentence", because it's redundant.

Here's the balance of complementary adjectives, where they echo each
other:

> Network operations, management, and control require **efficient and
> exact** algorithms, especially now, when networks get more
> **performant, and reliable.**

Here's the balance of opposite adjectives:

> In *dynamic* routing we route a **single** demand in a ***loaded***
> network, as opposed to *static* routing, where we route **many**
> demands in an ***unloaded*** network.

Uncoordinated balance
---------------------

We can balance even uncoordinated grammatical units, i.e., units of
different types.  Here we balance the subject phrase and the object
phrase (different types of the same grammatical unit: a noun phrase),
where the latter echoes the former:

> **Searching for a cheapest solution in the search graph**
> corresponds to **searching for a pair of paths of lowest cost in the
> input graph.**

Here's an example of uncoordinated balance, done twice:

> For that large problem sizes we *could not have used* the existing
> **optimal methods** (e.g., the brute-force algorithm, the integer
> linear programming) since ***they are inefficient***, and *neither
> could we have used* the existing ***efficient methods*** (e.g., the
> edge-exclusion algorithm, the tabu search), since **they are
> suboptimal**.

Uncoordinated balance:

* "optimal methods" (an object) vs "they are suboptimal" (a relative
  clause),

* "they are inefficient" (a relative clause) vs "efficient methods"
  (an object).

For emphasis, I also echoed the inability to use the methods: "we
could not have used", and "neither could we have used".

Conclusion
==========

* Have something to say, and say it clearly.  Then refine to your
  taste.

* When balancing, try to put the shorter first, then the longer.

* Refine wisely.  Overdoing it might be lavish, and phony.
