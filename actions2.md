# Introduction

Sentences become clear when verbs express actions, because along come
conjunctions (e.g., because, if, when, how, but) which guide us
through the reasoning of the author, as in this example:

> Our schools have failed to teach basic skills **because** they do
> not understand **how** a cultural background influences learning.

The revised sentence above is compound (has three clauses, because it
has three verbs), while the original sentence has just one clause:

> The cause of our schools' failure at teaching basic skills is not
> understanding the influence of a cultural background on learning.

In clear writing, it's not the number of clauses that count, but how
ideas and reasoning are presented in a coherent story.

In the original sentence, we have to deduce how one nominalization is
related to another.  Instead of using conjunctions, that we normally do
(e.g., "because", "how"), the original sentence uses nominalizations
(e.g., "cause", "failure") and prepositions (e.g., "of", "at"), which
describe how the nominalizations are related.

We might argue that we understood the original sentence, and so it's
OK.  However, it's not OK when you have to read an article full of
such sentences.

## Example #1

This sentence is unclear because its story and grammar do not match:

> Once upon a time, as a walk through the woods was taking place on
> the part of Little Red Riding Hood, the Wolf's jump out from behind
> a tree occurred, causing her fright.

The problem is that the main characters are not the subjects, and the
main actions are not the verbs.

Whole subjects (which are somewhat long):

* a walk through the woods,

* the Wolf's jump out from behind a tree.

Verbs (which are rather vague):

* was taking place,

* occurred.

Better:

> Once upon a time, Little Red Riding Hood *was walking* through the
> woods, **when** the Wolf *jumped out* from behind a tree **and**
> *frightened* her.

## Example #2

Let's consider another example from the book (no wonder it's about
politics):

> The Federalists' argument in regard to the destabilization of
> government by popular democracy was based on their belief in the
> tendency of factions to further their self-interest at the expense
> of the common good.

**A note on terminology**: popular democracy = common people (perhaps
elected).  In this example, the phrase "government by popular
democracy" does not describe a type of democracy, i.e., it's not a
democracy created by popular democracy.

**Before reading on, please try to revise the example.**

To revise the sentence, we need to understand it.  What do we learn
from it?

* The Federalists argued that the popular democracy destabilized the
  government.

* The Federalists believed that factions (of the popular democracy)
  tend to further their self-interest at the expense of the common
  good.

When we make the story match the grammar (i.e., the doers are the
subjects, the actions are expressed by verbs), the sentence is more
clear and direct:

> The Federalists argued that popular democracy destabilized
> government, because they believed that factions tended to further
> their self-interest at the expense of the common good.

In the original example, the actions were expressed by
nominalizations: destabilization, and tendency.  In the revised
example, we expressed the actions by verbs (destabilize, and tend),
and used conjunctions to walk readers through our reasoning.

# Conclusion

* If you can, avoid nominalizations and the prepositions they require.

* Use verbs and conjunctions to describe your reasoning.
