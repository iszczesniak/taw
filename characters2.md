# Characters and the passive voice

You might have already been given advice on how to write academically:
use the passive voice, so that your writing is impartial.  That's
misguided advice, because the passive voice can only make your writing
*look* impartial.  Most likely, your writing will be biased anyway, as
most writings are. Trying to be impartial is better than pretending.

Follow the advice of the best publishers.  The publisher of Nature
advises their prospective authors to write in the active voice.  Once
I was told that the abstracts of articles submitted to IEEE journals
should be written in the passive voice, but I wasn't able to
corroborate it with the IEEE author guides.

Using the passive can be problematic in academic writing, where the
novelty of proposed ideas is crucial.  It's hard to discern the novel
contribution of an article, when its introduction and related-works
sections are written in the passive.  The bottom line is to state who
(us or cited authors) contributed what, and the active voice is better
for that.

# The need for the passive voice

Sometimes the passive voice is exactly what you need, as in the
following cases.

## We report well-known information

The passive is useful, when we report on something that we are not the
authors of, when we're only summarizing the common knowledge and
introducing the needed terminology.  For example:

> The optical spectrum is divided into fine frequency slot *units*.
> Contiguous *units* are concatenated to form a **slot**, which
> [**slot**] is tailored for a specific ***demand***.  A ***demand***
> (...)

We shouldn't use the active (it still would be acceptable, albeit a
bit confusing) to write on something that we didn't devise:

> We divide the optical spectrum into fine frequency slot *units*.  We
> form a **slot** by concatenating contiguous *units*, so that a
> specific ***demand*** can use the **slot**.  A ***demand*** (...)

## We need to rearrange a sentence

The passive swaps the places of the characters.  Compare the two:

> A dog bit a man.

> A man was bitten by a dog.

This can come handy in writing a coherent paragraph: we start a clause
with information known to a reader, and introduce new information at
the end of the clause, which is then picked up by the next clause.

In the examples about the optical spectrum above, please note the
places of the keywords *units*, **slot**, and ***demand***, which are
the new information.  The paragraph in the passive is coherent,
because the keywords are introduced and used in order, and the
paragraph in the active is not, because the keywords are mingled.

## Doers are unimportant or unknown

If we don't care about characters, we can drop them with the passive
voice.  For instance, we could write:

> We elected the president.

> Hurricanes, earth quakes, governments, and other plagues destroyed
> millions of lives over the decades.

> I'm barefoot, because some thief stole my shoes.

But the following might be preferred, if we are not interested in the
doers, but rather in the result:

> The president was elected.

> Millions of lives were destroyed over the decades.

> I'm barefoot, because my shoes were stolen.

## We need to hide the doer

We may want to deliberately impersonalize the sentence, because we
don't want to blame the doer.  Compare the two:

> The government failed to provide enough hospital beds.

> Hospital beds were in short supply.

# Conclusion

* The passive is good for reporting information we are not the authors
  of.

* The passive is handy in rearranging information in a sentence.

* The passive allows for dropping the unimportant or unknown doer.

* Prefer the active over the passive, but be wary not to abuse the
  active.  If you use "we think" or "we believe", make sure you
  provide concrete, and valuable information, otherwise your writing
  can feel sloppy and baseless.
