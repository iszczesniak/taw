# Actions and nominalization

We know we should avoid nominalizations if we can better express
actions with verbs.  Nonetheless, it is easy to abuse nominalizations
in the following cases.

## A nominalization followed by "is to"

> Our *intention* **is to** reform the law.

> We *intend* to reform the law.

## There is, there are... nominalizations.

> **There is** a *need* for *vaccination*.

> We *need* to *vaccinate*.

## A nominalization with a verb of little meaning

Note how "carried out" is gone; it's superfluous:

> We **carried out** *a simulation* of the network.

> We *simulated* the network.

# Spot-on nominalizations

Nominalizations have their niche, just as the passive voice has,
mostly because they help us express information in the usual way
familiar to readers.

## A nominalization as a technical term

Technical terms are often nominalizations, frequently used and
expected by readers of a specific domain.  These nominalizations name
*repetitive actions* that are known to readers.  An example of such a
nominalization is **routing** in optical networking, as used here:

> Routing of a single connection is one of the most important tasks of
> operating an optical network.

In the revision below we removed that nominalization, but readers
familiar with networking are likely to be perplexed, because they
expected to see "routing":

> Optical network operators carry out a number of tasks, most
> importantly they **route** a single connection.

*Revision* is also a nominalization.  Instead of writing "In the
sentence below that we revised", we can quickly write "In the revision
below" which taxes our mental effort less.  Revision is a concept (a
part of the writing process) that we know well.  So is nominalization.

## A way to simplify a compound sentence

Here we have a compound sentence where the subordinate clause "what
she contributed" is an object of the main clause:

> We acknowledge **what she contributed**.

A nominalization can name the action:

> We acknowledged **her contribution**.

## A shortcut to previous actions

Nominalizations are useful in referring to actions that were mentioned
before.  For instance, we can make the subordinate clause "what we
concluded before" a subject of another clause:

> **What we concluded before** makes us believe we are on the right
    track.

But this one is shorter:

> **Our conclusions** make us believe we are on the right track.

## A way to get rid of "the fact that..."

I haven't used "the fact that" in a long, long time like this:

> **The fact that we efficiently solved the problem** is a proof that
> the problem is not NP-complete.

Because it's easier and more elegant to use a nominalization:

> **Our efficient solution** is a proof that the problem is not
> NP-complete.

# Conclusion

* Watch out for common nominalization abuses.

* Nominalizations can be useful technical terms.

* Nominalizations can simplify a sentence.

* We used "nominalization" 22 times on these two pages.  Catch 22.
