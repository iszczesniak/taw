Technicalities: how to refer to names of variables
--------------------------------------------------

What is the correct way of referring to the variable names?  Here are
some possibilities:

* a speed s
* an s speed
* the speed s
* the s speed
* speed s
* s speed

We should consider:

* the publisher guidance, e.g., IEEE prefers dropping articles, and
  putting the variable name at the end of the phrase:

  - We examined path P.

* the personal preference,

  - We examined a/the path P.

  - Some prefer: The f function.

  - Others prefer: The function f.

* whether a variable refers to countable or uncountable quantities,
  e.g.,

  We measured air volume V.

  We measured the air volume V.

  But rather not: We measured an air volume V.

  We estimated love L.

  We counted the number N of people.

  We counted the N number of people.

  We counted the number of people N.

  We counted N people.

ADVICE: You are free to write in any way, but be consistent.  It's
best to follow the convention used in seminal articles.
