# Shape of a sentence - part 2

Some articles, even though published in peer-reviewed journals, are
replete with ungainly sentences.  We should read our writing
carefully, and rewrite if we're not sure what we wrote.

This long sentence is unclear and clumsy:

> The proposed algorithm was inspired by the generic programming
> paradigm which is based on mathematical abstraction, which makes
> generic data structures and algorithms operate on any algebraic
> structure, which have the required properties, such as operations or
> ordering relations.

Which refers to which?  We get confused about what exactly the
dependent clauses that are chained together refer to.  We can break
that chain, and refocus reader's attention by turning a relative
clause into a **modifier**, of which there are three kinds:
*resumptive*, *summative*, and *free*.  *A modifier is either a clause
or a phrase*.

# Resumptive modifiers

A resumptive modifier starts with a noun, a verb, or an adjective
**repeated** from the previous clause we want to stress and resume
with, as in here:

> We propose an efficient and exact algorithm: **efficient** as it can
> solve large problems, and **exact** as its results are optimal.

Instead, we could have written two relative clauses ("which is
efficient", and "which is exact"), a bit tediously:

> We propose an algorithm, which is efficient as it can solve large
> problems, and which is exact as its results are optimal.

# Summative modifiers

A summative modifier starts with a noun, a verb, or an adjective
that's a gist of the previous clause, and something we want to focus
on, as in here:

> If a client does not fully utilize the fixed spectrum of the
> assigned wavelength, the spectrum of the precious erbium window is
> wasted, **a technological shortcomming** addressed by the elastic
> optical networks.

We could have used a relative clause, and *vaguely* refer to what went
before:

> If a client does not fully utilize the fixed spectrum of the
> assigned wavelength, the spectrum of the precious erbium window is
> wasted, which is addressed by the elastic optical networks.

# Free modifiers

A relative clause usually refers to the *object* of the preceeding
clause:

> Governments stockpiled the personal protective masks, which [i.e.,
> the masks, not the governments] were terribly needed later.

A relative clause could also refer to the subject of the preceeding
clause:

> Governments stockpiled the personal protective masks, which [the
> masks or maybe the governments?] were much appreciated later.

If we want to praise the governments, we could write:

> Governments stockpiled the personal protective equipment, which was
> planned wisely in anticipation of a pandemic.

A free modifier can help us be more elegant and subtle.  A free
modifier attaches to a clause, letting us talk about the *explicit
subject* of that clause.  The *implied subject* of the free modifier
should be the same as the *explicit subject* of the clause the free
modifier attaches to.  Here the explicit and the implicit subjects are
the governments:

> Governments stockpiled the personal protective masks, planning
> wisely and anticipating a pandemic.

A free modifier can both begin and end a sentence, and hence its name:
free (as in freedom, unfettered, not as in free beer).  In the example
above, we can move the free modifier to the beginning:

> Planning wisely and anticipating a pandemic, governments stockpiled
> the personal protective equipment.

A free modifier can be slippery: the implied subject of the free
modifier should be the same as the explicit subject we want to refer
to; don't miss the target.  If you fail, you'll dangle your modifier,
as in this example, where the implied subject is someone who planned,
while the explicit subject is the equipment:

> Planning wisely and anticipating a pandemic, personal protective
> equipment was stockpiled.

# Conclusion

* Break a chain of nested relative clauses with a modifier.

* We got to know the resumptive, summative and free modifiers.

* Watch out: don't dangle free modifiers.
