Good writing does not make or break your paper.  Badly-written papers
are published in reputable journal, and well-written papers can be
rejected, because novely counts more than good writing.  How to be
successfull at publishing is another story.

Nonetheless, good writing is a plus.  Bad writing is a common reason
for rejection because editors and reviewers do not have to put up with
it.

Our writing should be clear, because the technicalities we write about
are already complex.

In the research community, the burden of communication is put on the
writer, i.e., the readers expect from a writer a text that is easy to
follow.

Have something to say, and say it clearly.

Dijkstra:

* Complexity sells better than simplicity.

* Simplicity is a great girtua but requires hard work to achieve and
  appreciate.
