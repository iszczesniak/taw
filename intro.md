Good writing does not make or break your paper.  Badly-written papers
are published in reputable journal, and well-written papers can be
rejected, because novely counts more than good writing.  How to be
successfull at publishing is another story.

Nonetheless, good writing is a plus.  Bad writing is a common reason
for rejection because editors and reviewers do not have to put up with
it.

Have something to say, and say it clearly.
