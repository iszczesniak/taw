# Reviews

* Reviews are a must.  It's also a privilege: you get someone to get
  to know your work, and *you can get valuable feedback*.

* The better the journal or conference, the harsher and more critical
  the reviews, and so the *better articles they publish*.

* Journal reviews are more careful than conference reviews, because
  journals ask the authors to reply to reviews, while in conferences
  authors usually have no chance to do it, though sometimes authors
  are allowed to write a rebuttal (which is usually ignored).

* Reviewers want to write reviews: it looks good on their CVs, they
  are just interested in reading new articles.

* Reviews are asked for by "shepherds" (associate editors, technical
  program committee members), who often are those, whom you know.  So
  it may be socially hard to decline a review.

# Reviews in practice

Good reviews take time and effort, and so good reviews are rare.
Furthermore, a review is not a detailed account or a scrutiny, so you
should not expect a reviewer to point out every mistake in your work.
Correcting those mistakes and shortcomings is your job.

A typical **neglectful** review is this:

> Uninteresting, untimely, incremental work of low quality and novel
> contribution close to none.  We advise the author revise the English
> and presentation.  This was all done before.

These are some weird comments that I got from reviewers:

* the English is inadequate (I wonder what they meant),

* the authors use high-school mathematics (it is good or bad?),

* the English is very bad (the reviewer spotted a missing comma, which
  was debatable anyway),

* the article has too many technical details (it was a comment about a
  technical paper).

Therefore shepherds (those who ask for reviews and decide the fate of
the submission) give this advice to reviewers:

> As always, your help in providing a timely, thoughtful review is
> most appreciated.

Where:

* timely = don't be late (reviewers are notoriously late),

* thoughtful = do a good job:

  - don't be nasty, and thoughtless,

  - read and understand, then write a review.

# Typical review criteria

* Relevance and timeliness:

  * Do *a thing right* or do *a right thing*?  Doing a thing right is
    not enough, i.e., solving well any problem is not enough.  You
    should do the right thing, i.e., solve an important (relevant, and
    current) problem.

* Technical content:

  * even if you present a novel idea, you have to back your claim with
    technical details: equations, algorithms, measurements, and
    proofs.  No wonder that reviewers look at figures, and algorithms
    first,

  * so beef up your contribution with technical details.

* Quality of presentation:

  * English,

  * organization,

  * quality of figures, tables, equations.

* Novelty and originality:

  * have something to say, some novel idea, something that people
    need.

# Advice

You can help yourself by making the job of a reviewer easier, i.e.,
write the article in such a way, that it's easy for the reviewer to
write a review:

  * have a good problem, and define it well,

  * be conspicuous about novelty,

  * make your paper convincing with technical details,

  * don't botch the writing job.

# Conclusion

* **Have something to say, and say it well.**

* **Good work eventually gets accepted at a good place.**
