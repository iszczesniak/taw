# Introduction

These are my notes on Technical Academic Writing, a graduate course
that I'm teaching.  The notes are based on the excellent book "Style:
Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace" by Joseph M. Williams.

The book has many spot-on examples with elegant explanations, but I
had to prepare short notes since the course is rather short.  I tried
to be point-blank, yet not to trivialize.
