# Introduction

These are my notes on Technical Academic Writing, a graduate course
that I'm teaching.  The notes are based on the excellent book "Style:
Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace" by Joseph M. Williams.  The book has
many spot-on examples with elegant explanations, but I had to prepare
short notes since the course is rather short.  I tried to be
point-blank, yet not to trivialize.

# Assignment

Please write an academic abstract of a thousand characters (spaces
included) on your work (I promise to keep it confidential) or
something you make up.  I will grade:

Please submit the best you can because I cannot accept corrections.

**Deadline: the last lecture.**
