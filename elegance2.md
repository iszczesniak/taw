# Elegance - part 2

Warning: some what you are about to read is a bit extravagant and may
get you in trouble with those reviewers who think that only
impersonal, passive, flat, and bleached writing earns the title of the
academic writing.  That's just part of the job description.

# Emphasis

We can emphasise with nominalization and chiasmus.

## Nominalization

Really.  Sometimes nominalizations are useful.  An adjective turned
into a noun is a nominalization too.  We could have ended the
following sentence with "the new information", repetitive and
redundant, but "the new" is quicker, and sounds like a snare drum
beat.

> It's no coincidence that we start a sentence with the old
> information, and end with the new.

## Chiasmus

Chiasmus ("crossing" in Greek) is a stylistic emphasis device, where
we swap the order of information to attract attention.  Here we
swapped "end" with "the new".  It attracts attention, because it is
playful, it sounds different.  It's like a bit of chili in chocolate.

> It's no coincidence that we *start* a sentence with **the old**
> information, and let **the new** *end*.

# Metaphor

Metaphor is all around us.  When a girl says the guy killed the mood,
we know that nobody was murdered.  Aristotle wrote:

> By far the greatest thing is to be a master of metaphor.  It is the
> one thing that cannot be learned from others.  It is a sign of
> genius, for a good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of
> similarity among dissimilars.

A good metaphor is worth a thousand words, and brings life to
technical writing, but it will backlash if you do it wrong.  Once I
described a commonly-used method like this:

> Using the Yen algorithm, which enumerates all paths, to solve the
> stated problem is like looking for a needle in a haystack by
> examining each stem one by one.

To my surprise, I was told to tone down my derogatory, discrediting
and condescending tone.  I thought my metaphor was particularly fine,
a lively observation, but those who used this approach in their work
must have felt offended.  I think I alienated my reviewers.

In retrospect, I should have narrated nebulously using the passive
voice with a couple of nominalizations.  Those who wanted to know
would have gotten my point.

# Personification

Personification attributes human traits to non-humans, and has been
used long before Aesop.  We like personification since our childhoods,
as it makes stories come to life.  I like it even in technical
academic writing:

> A tentative solution wants to become permanent, but instead it can
> be discarded or never processed.

Again, it might not be appreciated by reviewers or editors, criticized
for being "conversational".  If needed, you'll have to back down and
revert to the standard:

> The objective of a tentative solution is to become permanent, but
> instead it can be discarded or never processed.

# Conclusion

* Nominalizations are good for ending a clause or a sentence.

* Try out chiasmus.

* Use metaphor and personalization at your own risk.

* Perfunctory reviews often are about the obvious and the easy, the
  supposedly unacademic style.

A quote from Samuel Johnson:

> Read over your compositions, and wherever you meet with a passage
> which you think is particularly fine, strike it out.
