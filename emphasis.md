title: Emphasis

Introduction
============

We, as humans, are most interested in how something starts and ends,
anything in between is less important (something to ruminate over
later, if ever).  For the same reason, we are most interested in how a
sentence (a paragraph, a section, or an article) *starts and ends*:
the beginning and the end are the focal points.  It's no coincidence
that we start a sentence with the old information, and end with the
new.  But there is more to it.

Our writing not only should be clear, it should also be
**convincing**, and to that end we employ **emphasis**.

Emphasis
========

To achieve the best emphasis, the important information usually should
be put at *the end of the sentence*, because:

* the beginning of the sentence is already taken to set up the
  context, and we need that context to be clear,

* we take a pause after reading a sentence and think for a while what
  the sentence was about, and we recall the end of the sentence the
  most vividly.

**Keep that ending simple**, move any extra information to the
sentence beginning to setup the context.  Compare the two:

* We compute set $S$ of slots for which we filter the input graph, and
  search for a shortest path, **for a given demand and available
  modulations**.

* **For a given demand and available modulations**, we compute set $S$
  of slots for which we filter the input graph, and search for a
  shortest path.

We used that insight before to introduce the new information at the
end of a sentence.  Now we know it doesn't always have to be new:
important is good too.

Example
-------

In the sentence below, we emphasize that a path should be found
*fast*, which, hopefully, is even more emphasized by the contrast of
the lengthy and laborious sentence beginning, and the swift ending:

> Given the increasing deployment of optical networks, network
> densification, softwarization of the network control, the
> ever-increasing need for bandwidth and agility, further increased by
> content-oriented services, network and service orchestration, and
> the next-generation wireless network requirements: a shortest
> optical path should be found *fast*.

Devices
=======

There are a number of devices that attract attention.  Here are a few.

Whatever it takes
-----------------

You can be creative in stressing your point, fulfill your aesthetic
needs, and get a thrill.  You can be a bit frivolous, and that will
fly, if you keep the rest of your text meticulous and impeccable.  And
so I came up with this:

> We reformulate edge relaxation.  In Dijkstra, an edge is relaxed
> when a candidate label is better than the vertex label.  In generic
> Dijkstra, we relax an edge when there is no better vertex label than
> the candidate label. **A small tweak.**

> This tweak makes no difference when the relation between labels is a
> strict total order, as in Dijkstra.  However, for our label order,
> the tweak entails we relax an edge not only for better labels, but
> also for incomparable labels.  **A big difference.**

But
---

We've been told not to begin a sentence with "but".  But we can use it
to emphasize a point.  I like this one, because it makes the reader
grab a pencil to correct this, supposedly, blunt mistake, especially
when they feel educated.

Not only..., but also...
------------------------

> However, for our label order, the tweak entails we relax an edge
> **not only for** better labels, **but also for** incomparable
> labels.

What we need is...
------------------

We should keep our writing succinct, but sometimes we can spare a few
extra words to stress what we need:

* We need an efficient algorithm.

* What we need is an efficient algorithm.

Conclusion
==========

* Your writing should not only be clear, but also convincing.

* Put the important information at the end of a sentence.

* Keep the important information simple, and easy to remember.
