# Introduction

As humans we are interested in who did what and to whom.  Once we know
the character that is prominently put as the subject, we want to know
what that character did, and that's best expressed with a verb.  Often
we need an object to say to whom something was done.

Let's revise some basic terminology.  A noun is a part of speech.
When used in a sentence, a noun becomes a part of sentence: most often
a subject or an object.  Examples:

* A dog bit a man. dog = subject, man = object
* A man bit a dog. man = subject, dog = object

In clear writing, the story and the grammar should match: characters
with subjects, and actions with verbs.

# Advice

**Make important actions verbs.** That will come easier if you already
  made a character a subject of your sentence.

## Example

This sentence is unclear:

> _**The cause of our schools' failure at teaching basic skills**_ is
> **not understanding** *the influence of a cultural background on
> learning*.

We need to rewrite it to make it clear.  First, we notice that a
subject of that sentence is very long, complicated, and packed with
information: _**the cause of our school's failure at teaching basic
skills**_.  Next, the verb is abstract, and negated: **is not
understanding**; from that verb we learn little concrete, and it
forces use to negate our logic.  Finally, the object is also long and
complicated: *the influence of a cultural background on learning*.

The sentence has one verb only.  The characters and the subject are
mismatched, so are the verb and the actions.  Actions are hidden in
noun phrases with: failure, teaching, influence, and learning.

We notice that the characters are: the schools, cultural background,
and children.  We know that the schools failed, and that they do not
understand.  We're talking about how children learn, and how their
learning is influenced by cultural background.

The main character seems to be the schools, so we make them the
subject of the main clause.  Now it's natural to express their failure
with a verb: "have failed", and "to teach" to say what specifically
they did wrong.  We dodged the nominalization "failure at teaching"
with two verbs.  Good.

Again the schools are the character ("they") of the dependent clause,
and we can directly state: "they do not understand", without
circuitous "is not understanding".

> Our schools have failed to teach basic skills because they do not
> understand how a cultural background influences the way children
> learn.

We make the cultural background, and the children the characters of
the dependent clauses, and we express their actions with verbs.  We're
using "how" twice, which is acceptable but rather inelegant:

> Our schools have failed to teach basic skills because they do not
> understand how a cultural background influences how children learn.

Or maybe better:

> Our schools have failed to teach basic skills because they do not
> understand how a cultural background influences learning.

And yet another variation:

> Our schools have failed to teach basic skills because they do not
> understand how children learn depending on their cultural
> background.

We could argue that rewriting changes the meaning of sentences.
Perhaps the author of the original sentence wanted to emphasize the
cause.  True, there might be nuanced shades of meaning that might be
important, but only the author might notice.  If something is
important indeed, it should be stated conspicuously.  Unimportant
shades of meaning can be dropped.  Clarity remains the utmost virtue.

# Conclusion

* Make the main character the subject of the sentence.

* Express with a verb that the character does.

* Clarity is the goal, not subjective shades of meaning.
